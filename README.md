# CONQUEST

**CONQUEST** is a strategic game with a rich story, similar in style to Dungeons & Dragons (D&D). The project is currently in development and programmed in JavaScript, with HTML and CSS elements.

## Project Overview

CONQUEST is designed to blend tactical gameplay with an engaging narrative, providing players with an experience akin to traditional D&D adventures. While still in development, the core mechanics and structure of the game are being built with modern web technologies.

## Features

- **Strategic Gameplay**: Players will engage in decision-making and tactical combat.
- **Immersive Story**: A rich storyline unfolds as players progress through the game.
- **Interactive Web Interface**: The game is played directly in the browser.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: Handles the core game logic and interaction.
- **HTML/CSS**: Provides the structure and design of the game interface.
- **Visual Studio Code (VSCode)**: Used for development, with the help of various extensions.

## Running the Project

To run the project, you will need a live server setup, as the game cannot run properly by simply opening the HTML file from your local filesystem. You can use the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension in Visual Studio Code to serve the project and view it correctly in the browser.

### Steps to Run:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project folder in **Visual Studio Code**.
3. Install the **Live Server** extension from the VSCode marketplace.
4. Right-click on the `index.html` file and select **Open with Live Server**.
5. The game will automatically open in your default browser.

**Note**: Opening the game files directly from the file system (e.g., `file://`) will not work due to certain browser restrictions.

## Future Development

This project is still under active development. Upcoming features include:

- Character creation system.
- Multiplayer capabilities.
- Dynamic world-building with procedural generation.
- **Advanced Equipment System**: Players will unlock and equip a wide variety of items as they progress.

## Long-Term Future Features

In the long term, several new features and mechanics are planned for CONQUEST, including:

- **Comprehensive Item System**: 
    - With 12 different classes, each class will have its own unique set of items.
    - **Item rarities**: There will be 6 different levels of rarity for items: Typical, Atypical, Rare, Epic, Legendary, and Mythic.
    - **Equipment slots**: Each player will have 10 equipment slots to fill: Chestplate, Helmet, Leggings, Clothes, Main Hand, Off Hand, Cape, Ring 1, Ring 2, and Rune.
    - **Item unlocking**: Players will unlock new items every 5 levels (for a total of 12 unlock tiers across 60 levels of progression).
    - Given the 12 classes, 6 rarity levels, 10 types of equipment, and 12 tiers of item unlocking, the total number of unique items for player equipment alone will be **8,640 items**.

This will allow for deep customization and build variety as players progress through the game. The long-term goal is to ensure that each player's experience feels unique, with a robust system that rewards both strategy and progression.

## Conclusion

CONQUEST is an ambitious and evolving project. With a focus on tactical gameplay, a rich narrative, and a dynamic item system, the game will offer an in-depth experience for both casual players and hardcore strategists alike. Keep an eye out for regular updates as new features are continuously added!
